DiceRoll-Password-Gen
=====================

Use word lists to make a passphrase.

For Python2.7

Usage:
python DiceRollPW.py \<# of words in passphrase\> \<word list 1\> [word list ...]

Word lists can be CSV or delimited by spaces. Other delimiters may work as it tries to detect the delimiter. Currently you have to run the program in the directory with the dictionaries unless you give absolute paths.

To-do:
-Make it more resilient to bad input
-Add options to substitute numbers or symbols for letters
